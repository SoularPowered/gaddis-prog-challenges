1. Miles per Gallon
Write a program that calculates a carâ€™s gas mileage. The program should ask the user to
enter the number of gallons of gas the car can hold and the number of miles it can be
driven on a full tank. It should then calculate and display the number of miles per gallon
the car gets.
